##Research statement##

I am currently engaged in the study of public opinion attitudes towards European integration, with a particular focus on support for solidarity policies. This has become prominent in light of the various crises experienced by the EU in the last decades, taking into account the conflicts that these have brought to the forefront, both between countries and within countries.
First, I have worked on the determinants and consequences of solidarity towards European states or citizens, for example, whether attitudes towards solidarity have consequences in terms of electoral behavior. Secondly, I have focused on Europolitanism, a European form of transnationalism, to study its consequences in terms of attitudes, by showing that transnational experiences reduce fears and promote the inclusion of immigrants, and political behavior (transnationalism promotes greater participation in European politics and favors mobilisation for green and left-wing parties).
Finally, I study representation in terms of both congruence and responsiveness between elites and voters. In my doctoral thesis, I studied the responsiveness of Italian parties and governments to citizensâ€™ policy priorities. Furthermore, I have also worked on an ERC funded project called ResponsiveGov at the University of Leicester, where I was responsible for data collection and coordination of other coders on various policy junctures. Finally, I collaborated on the elite survey conducted in the REScEU project.
More recently, I have started to focus on the analysis of eco-social policies from the perspective of public opinion, i.e., policies for the transition to a green economy that also include forms of compensation for the most affected social categories. In this regard I have recently collaborated on the drafting of a survey conducted in five European countries, in which we analyze precisely these characteristics also with a survey experiment. Finally, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I started investigating attitudes towards energy and compensation policies.
