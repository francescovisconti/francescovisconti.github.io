## Statement

The main goal of my research is to study public opinion attitudes towards European integration, with a particular focus on support for solidarity: what determines public support for European solidarity, and what are its political consequences for party competition.  

Secondly, I am interested in understanding the political consequences of individual transnationalism: is the transnationalisation of everyday lives across the EU translating into the transnationalisation of the political process?  

Recently, I started to focus on the analysis of eco-social policies, i.e., policies for the transition to a green economy that also include forms of  compensation for the most affected social categories.  

Finally, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I became interested in investigating attitudes towards energy and compensation policies.  

I pursue this research in the broader context of public support for European integration.
