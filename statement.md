## Statement

My research can be summarised in a few keywords: European Union, free movement, solidarity, climate change, and public opinion.

Starting with the research topics related to the EU, I have worked on studying public preferences for European integration, particularly concerning specific support for supranational solidarity policies, understood as the sharing of risks among citizens and member states. On the one hand, I have contributed to the analysis of the determinants of support for solidarity and, on the other hand, to the consequences of European solidarity preferences for political competition and representation across the EU.

The second major research cluster relates to the consequences of freedom of movement and is divided into two branches. First, I have studied the consequences of transnationalism, contacts and experiences with people and cultures of other member countries, on attitudes and political behaviour. The second line of research concerning freedom of movement focuses instead on the political consequences of emigration. In my studies, I have explored the relationship between concerns about emigration and preferences for greater investment in national and European social policies, how political trust relates to concerns for co-nationals exiting their country of origin, or how the latter could influence electoral behaviour if it gets politicized.

More recently, I have worked on climate change and its politicisation by analysing support for energy transition and eco-social policies. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I investigated attitudes towards energy and compensation policies across the EU. Lately, I have edited a special issue on the politicization of climate change in Italy. Eventually, I have collaborated on the design of a cross-national survey, in which we gauge public support for eco-social policies also through a survey experiment.
